# personal-portfolio
My personal portfolio showcases my work and experience

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a personal portfolio where future employers can see my work and ongoing projects.

I created a space where I briefly introduce myself and what I do. Following the introduction I lead the user towards my current projects, completed and ongoing. Along with that also created a section to showcase my skills such as programming languages and software I am skilled in using. Lastly a deeper dive into who I am and a contact section where the user can reach me.

Some fun features that I used were sticky positioning on the menu, a two-column layout on the hero section, and a grid of images.

Below is a screenshot of the finished website. (screenshot was done on 4K monitor, hence the exaggerated width)
